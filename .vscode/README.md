# 🎵 Lyrics Effect Project
A Python-based application that synchronizes song lyrics with audio playback.

## 🚀 Project Overview
This project was built to demonstrate real-time text manipulation and audio synchronization using Python. It uses the `pygame` library to handle audio and standard output flushing for a smooth "typing" effect.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Language:** Python 3
- **Libraries:** `pygame`, `time`, `sys`
- **Tools:** VS Code, Git

## 📂 File Structure
- `Lyrics_effect.py`: The main logic script.
- `about_you.mp3`: The audio file used for the demonstration.

## 💡 How it Works
The script calculates the timing for each line of the lyrics and uses a typewriter effect to display them as the music plays.
